# Debugging npm-triggered Nodemon-run Node processes in VS Code

This is a minimal demo for it.

## Installation

1. Fork this if you want to
2. Clone it locally
3. `npm install`

## Trying it out

1. Open the root directory in your VS Code (e.g. `code .`)
2. Hit <kbd>F5</kbd> to trigger the default Launch config, or select it manually from the Debugger’s configurations dropdown and click the Run button.
3. Set a breakpoint on line 4 of `server.js`
4. Navigate to the URL displayed in the program's terminal
5. **BAM!** Debugging.

You’re welcome.
